# 🦾 Multi-Part Multi-Location Pick-and-Place Simulation Using NLMPC (MATLAB)

This repository contains a MATLAB-based simulation for a **multi-part, multi-location pick-and-place robotic system** controlled using **Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NLMPC)**. The simulation demonstrates how a **single robotic arm** can efficiently and accurately handle multiple objects from various source locations and deliver them to distinct target positions in a **single operational cycle**.

The NLMPC framework integrates:
- ✅ Real-time path optimization
- ✅ Penalization of velocity and acceleration for smooth motion
- ✅ Terminal constraints to ensure precise end-effector stopping
- ✅ Euclidean distance constraints for high terminal accuracy

This project is ideal for researchers, students, and engineers working on advanced robot motion planning, MPC, or industrial automation strategies.
